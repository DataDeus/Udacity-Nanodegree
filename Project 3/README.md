# Propser Loan data application
## by Eliel Godsent


## Investigation and Dataset Overview

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Exploratory Findings

To be able to explore the data, some of the steps I took involved:
- Removing missing values
- Converting to the right data type
- replacing column values

After succesfully carrying out the above mentioned tasks to clean the data, here are some findings I discovered in the exploratory phase of the project:

- There are outliers in the data
- Most of loans were taken in 2014
- There are more lesser loans than there are higher loans
- 77.04% of loans are of the one year term, this is the most common loan term
- There are more paid loans than there are overdue loans, however, most of the loans are still ongoing...
- There are more people with lesser interest rates than there are people with higher interest rates
- There are lesser people with higher Yields - this could mean that the servicing is fee is prolly higher for higher interest rates and probably validates why there are most people with lower interest rates
- There are slightly more people that own a home, ther are 50.45%
- Debt consolidation is the most occuring category
- There is no correlation between the loan amount and the interest rate
- There are more investors for smaller loans than there are for larger loans
- People who cancelled their loans took loans of very little amount as oppose to other loan status
- Home owners borrow the most money than people who are not home owners
- There are more home owners with an income range of $50k+ than home owners with an income of $100k
- there seems to be a correlation between interest rate and lenders yield
- Accross all terms, at least 5% of loans have beeen completed
- there is a negative correlation between investors and LP service fees
- For higher loans amounts there are more people with unverified incomes
- There are more lesser loans than there are higher loans
- Most of loans were taken in 2014
- Loans of term one year are either completed or charged off
- The most popular loan status are current loans
- Most of the loans are still ongoing


## Key Insights included for Presentation

- Line chart showing timeline of loan amount

From my analysis, some conclusins are:
- More people are likely to take a loan for a three year term
- More poeple are likely to pay back their loan
